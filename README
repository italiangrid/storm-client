Building the SRM clients
========================

To create RPM using ETICS
-------------------------
This component is included in the StoRM project or StoRM subsystem. You need to run what follows to create its RPM:

1. download ETICS clients following instructions at
   https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/ETICS/ClientHowTo

2. create your working environment like
   > mkdir <trybuild>;
   > cd <trybuild>;
   > etics-workspace-setup

3. get ETICS component information
   > etics-get-project StoRM
   > etics-checkout --project-config 'StoRM v. 1.6.0-1 TEST new' -c 'StoRM.client v. 1.5.0-1 TEST' client

4. create rpm
   > etics-build -c 'StoRM.client v. 1.5.0-1 TEST' client
   > ls -al ../dist/StoRM/client/1.5.0/*

To create RPM without ETICS
---------------------------
You need to run what follows to create its RPM:

0. download StoRM common and StoRM client components
   > svn co --username joda https://svn.forge.cnaf.infn.it/svn/storm/backend/branches/BE_1.6 backend
   > svn co --username joda https://svn.forge.cnaf.infn.it/svn/storm/common/trunk common

1. create your working environment like
   > cd backend;
   > ./bootstrap
   > ./configure --prefix=<prefix> \
--with-globus-prefix=<globus-prefix> --with-globus-thr-flavor=gcc64dbgpthr --with-globus-nothr-flavor=gcc64dbg \
--with-cgsi-gsoap-location=<cgsi-gsoap-location> -enable-gsoapgsi \
--with-gsoap-location=<gsoap-location> --with-gsoap-wsdl2h-location=<gsoap-wsdl2h-location> \
--with-gsoap-version=2.7.6b --with-gsoap-wsdl2h-version=2.7.6b \
--with-glite-location=<glite-location> --with-voms-prefix=<voms-location> --with-voms-include=<voms-include-location> 

   or doing as follows:

   > /bin/bash compile_from_scratch.sh

2. create bin
   > make install

3. create rpm
   > make rpm

4. create tar
   > make distbin
   > make distsrc

Installing the SRM clients
==========================
rpm -i storm-client-gcc64dbgpthr-1.5.0-1.x86_64.rpm



Have a nice day!
